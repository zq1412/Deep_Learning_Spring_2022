## This is a repository to house the code for my final project of this course as well as the code for some homework assignments. 

## Final Project

My final project involved evaluating different types of optimizers on the LeNET-5 Neural Network using MNIST data. The optimizers I evaluated were stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch
gradient descent, RMSProp, and AdaGrad.

## Homework 1 

Buliding a fully-connected layer based NN to recognize handwritten digits - Details of assignment in pdf in "Homework 2" folder.

## Homework 2

Building LeNet for colorful image classification for the CIFAR-10 colorful image dataset -  Details of assignment in pdf in "Homework 3" folder.
