## This is a repository to house the code for my final project of the Intro to Deep Learning course I took at Rutgers as well as the code for a few assignments done in the course. 

## Final Project

My final project involved evaluating different types of optimizers on the LeNET-5 Neural Network using MNIST data. The optimizers I evaluated were stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch
gradient descent, RMSProp, and AdaGrad. I have also included my final report for the project as well labeled "final_report.pdf.

## Neural Network Recognizing Handwritten Digits

Built a fully-connected layer based NN to recognize handwritten digits.

## LeNet For Colorful Image Classification

Built the LeNet network for colorful image classification for the CIFAR-10 colorful image dataset.
